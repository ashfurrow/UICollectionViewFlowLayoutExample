# `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` Example

This is a small app that shows yo how to use simple `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` sublcasses and transition between them. You can get a lot of really nice layouts without any further modification than `init`.

Demonstrates:
- Custom `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` subclasses.
- How to implement `UICollectionViewCell` subclasses.
- How to change layouts (with animation).
- How to set up a collection view without a `.xib` or Storyboard.
